# Hot Drop
A student project for a single page website demonstrating API usage. Articles pulled from IGN's news feed populate the initial view; type a game title into the search bar to begin searching (an autocomplete will suggest games with info to help disambiguate). The game database is from [Giant Bomb](https://giantbomb.com), a video game wiki which provides release dates, a description, platforms, and box art. Each search result will display the information, as well as offer the top two news articles related to the game (or, the user can click for the 10 most recent relevant articles), and a YouTube link that will pull up a video of gameplay as well as comments. A comments section powered by Google Firebase is below each entry, provided the user logs in.
